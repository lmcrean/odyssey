# Odyssey - Creator Platform MVP Architecture

## Overview
A TypeScript-first creator monetization platform built for **MVP deployment** with 100-500 initial creators. Instagram-ish image sharing with direct creator monetization.

## Architecture Principles
- **MVP-First**: Start simple, add complexity later
- **TypeScript First**: Type safety across all layers
- **Vercel Native**: Optimized for Vercel deployment
- **Creator-Centric**: Focus on creator-fan direct monetization
- **Apps/Packages Structure**: Future-proof architecture from day 1

## MVP vs Post-MVP Breakdown

### 🎯 MVP Features (Instagram-ish + Payments)
**Core User Journey**: Creator signs up → Uploads images → Fan discovers → Fan pays creator

**Apps (MVP Implementation):**
- ✅ **apps/web** - React frontend (basic UI, image upload, payment flows)
- ✅ **apps/api** - Express API (auth, image handling, payment processing)
- ❌ **apps/payments** - Post-MVP (integrate directly in api initially)
- ❌ **apps/workers** - Post-MVP (process images synchronously initially)
- ❌ **apps/admin** - Post-MVP (not user-facing)

**Packages (MVP Implementation):**
- ✅ **packages/shared** - Core types, basic utilities
- ✅ **packages/auth** - JWT authentication, basic validation
- ✅ **packages/ui** - Essential components (Button, Input, Modal, ImageUpload)
- 🔄 **packages/media** - Image upload/display only (no video/audio processing)
- ❌ **packages/payments** - Post-MVP (keep Stripe integration simple in api)
- ❌ **packages/security** - Post-MVP (basic auth security only)
- ❌ **packages/observability** - Post-MVP (console.log initially)

### 🚀 Post-MVP Features (Scale & Polish)
**When you have 100+ creators and $10K+ monthly GMV:**

**Advanced Apps:**
- **apps/payments** - Dedicated payment processing, tax handling
- **apps/workers** - Background image processing, notifications
- **apps/admin** - Creator management, platform analytics

**Advanced Packages:**
- **packages/media** - Full video/audio processing, live streaming
- **packages/payments** - Multi-currency, fraud detection, tax compliance
- **packages/security** - GDPR tools, advanced auth, rate limiting
- **packages/observability** - Comprehensive monitoring, creator analytics

## What's Documented vs What We'll Build

### Keep Full Documentation (No Deletion Needed)
The detailed apps/ and packages/ documentation stays as-is because:
- 🏗️ **Structure guidance** - Shows where features belong as you grow
- 🤖 **AI coding help** - AI tools understand the intended architecture
- 👥 **Contributor clarity** - Open source contributors know where to add features
- 📈 **Growth roadmap** - Clear path from MVP to full platform

### MVP Implementation Strategy
1. **Create the full apps/packages structure** (folders + minimal files)
2. **Implement only MVP features** (marked with ✅ above)
3. **Stub out Post-MVP features** (marked with ❌ above)
4. **Gradually migrate** from basic implementations to full features

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- **50+ Active Creators**: Creators posting regularly
- **$5K+ Monthly GMV**: Gross merchandise value
- **1K+ Registered Users**: Total platform users
- **80%+ Payment Success**: Reliable payment processing

## Migration Path
The apps/packages structure ensures smooth migration:
1. **MVP**: Minimal implementations in existing structure
2. **Scale**: Gradually move features to dedicated apps/packages  
3. **Growth**: Add new apps/packages without refactoring existing code
