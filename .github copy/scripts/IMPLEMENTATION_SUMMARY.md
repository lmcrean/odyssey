# Issue Triage with Gemini AI - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds automated issue triage using Gemini AI to the `lmcrean/developer-portfolio` repository. The system runs every 10 minutes to analyze unlabeled issues and automatically apply appropriate labels.

## Files Created

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- `.github/workflows/issue-triage.yml` - Main workflow file that runs every 10 minutes

### Scripts Directory (`.github/scripts/`)
- `src/issue-triage.ts` - Main TypeScript script that performs the AI-powered issue triage
- `src/setup-labels.ts` - TypeScript script to set up recommended repository labels
- `src/test-triage.ts` - TypeScript test script to verify functionality locally
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output from TypeScript source
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts (including TypeScript)
- `package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions
- `README.md` - Complete documentation and setup instructions
- `SUGGESTED_LABELS.md` - List of recommended labels for developer portfolios
- `.gitignore` - Excludes node_modules, dist, and other files from version control

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Scheduling
- Runs every 10 minutes using GitHub Actions cron schedule
- Can be manually triggered via GitHub Actions UI
- Processes up to 50 unlabeled issues per run

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis
- Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model for issue analysis
- Analyzes issue title and body content
- Suggests 1-3 most appropriate labels from available repository labels
- Includes retry logic with exponential backoff

### 3. GitHub API Integration
- Fetches all repository labels dynamically
- Finds issues without labels (excluding pull requests)
- Applies suggested labels using GitHub REST API
- Includes comprehensive error handling

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Validates that only existing labels are applied
- Handles empty issue bodies gracefully
- Includes rate limiting to avoid overwhelming APIs
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring

## Required Setup

### Environment Variables/Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Must be added to repository secrets

### Optional: Label Setup
Repository owners can run the TypeScript setup script to create recommended labels for better categorization:

```bash
cd .github/scripts
npm install
npm run build
npm run setup-labels
```

## Benefits
1. **Automated Organization** - Issues are automatically categorized without manual intervention
2. **Consistent Labeling** - AI ensures consistent labeling standards across all issues
3. **Time Saving** - Reduces manual effort for repository maintainers
4. **Improved Discoverability** - Well-labeled issues are easier to find and prioritize
5. **Better Project Management** - Enables better filtering and reporting of issues

## Testing
- All scripts validated for syntax errors
- Test suite included to verify logic
- Comprehensive error handling and logging for monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Add the `GEMINI_API_KEY` to repository secrets
2. Optionally run the label setup script to create recommended labels
3. Monitor the workflow runs to ensure proper functionality
4. Adjust the cron schedule if needed based on repository activity

The implementation is production-ready and follows GitHub Actions best practices for security and reliability.
