## Testing Coverage

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| /api/ | ✅ PASS | API root endpoint is accessible |
| /api/posts/ | ✅ PASS | Posts endpoint returns data successfully |
| /api/profiles/ | ✅ PASS | Profiles endpoint returns data successfully |
| /api/comments/ | ✅ PASS | Comments endpoint returns data successfully |
| /api/messages/ | ✅ PASS | Messages endpoint returns 401/403 when not authenticated (expected) |
| Authentication endpoints | ✅ PASS | Login and registration endpoints are available |
| Rate limiting | ✅ PASS | API handles multiple requests properly |

## Findings

1. **Content Types**: Some endpoints return HTML content instead of JSON for some sites. The tests were adapted to handle both response types.

2. **Authentication Requirements**: The `/api/messages/` endpoint appropriately requires authentication, returning 401/403 status codes when accessed without credentials.

3. **Stability**: The rate limiting test shows that the APIs can handle moderate load without failure.

## Recommendations

1. Consider implementing authentication tests that include a login step and token verification.

2. Add tests for POST/PUT/DELETE operations to validate write operations.

3. Set up automated scheduled runs of these tests to monitor the production environment continuously.
