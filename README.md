Odyssey is a social media application that was build on a unified repository with React and Django Rest Framework, with a database hosted on PostgreSQL.

Users are able to discover other users with shared goals, follow and message them, and share their own progress and achievements on their journey.

The application allows users to create an account, post images, like and comment on posts, and follow other users, search and message other users.
