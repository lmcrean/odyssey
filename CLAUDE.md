# Odyssey - Competitor Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
A B2B competitive intelligence platform built with Angular frontend and C# ASP.NET Core backend, deployed to Google Cloud Platform.

## Implementation Status

### Iteration 1 (i1) - Hello World Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Establish basic Angular-to-C# API communication and deployment pipeline

#### Backend (apps/api) - C# ASP.NET Core
- ✅ Project structure with Controllers, Models, Middleware directories
- ✅ HealthController with `/api/health` (simple string) and `/api/health/status` (structured JSON)
- ✅ CORS configuration for Angular frontend (localhost:4200)
- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- ✅ Google Cloud Run deployment configuration (Dockerfile, cloudbuild.yaml)
- ✅ Environment-specific settings (Development/Production)

#### Frontend (apps/web) - Angular 18
- ✅ Standalone components architecture
- ✅ ApiService for HTTP communication with backend
- ✅ HelloWorldComponent displaying API responses
- ✅ Environment configurations (development/production)
- ✅ Firebase hosting configuration
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

#### Key Features Implemented
- Basic API health endpoints returning "Hello World" messages
- Angular component consuming C# API with structured response
- Environment-specific API URL configuration
- Google Cloud deployment ready (Cloud Run + Firebase)
- CORS properly configured for cross-origin requests

#### Next Steps (Iteration 2)
- Authentication system implementation
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control for B2B users
