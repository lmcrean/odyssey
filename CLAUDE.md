# Odyssey - Competitor Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
A B2B competitive intelligence platform built with Angular frontend and C# ASP.NET Core backend, deployed to Google Cloud Platform.

## Implementation Status

### Iteration 1 (i1) - Hello World Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Establish basic Angular-to-C# API communication and deployment pipeline

#### Backend (apps/api) - C# ASP.NET Core
- ✅ Project structure with Controllers, Models, Middleware directories
- ✅ HealthController with `/api/health` (simple string) and `/api/health/status` (structured JSON)
- ✅ Additional `/health` endpoint for workflow compatibility
- ✅ CORS configuration for Angular frontend (localhost:4200)
- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- ✅ Google Cloud Run deployment configuration (Dockerfile, cloudbuild.yaml)
- ✅ Environment-specific settings (Development/Production)
- ✅ Observability package integration with health metrics

#### Frontend (apps/web) - Angular 18
- ✅ Standalone components architecture
- ✅ ApiService for HTTP communication with backend
- ✅ HelloWorldComponent displaying API responses
- ✅ Environment configurations (development/production)
- ✅ Firebase hosting configuration
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

#### Key Features Implemented
- Basic API health endpoints returning "Hello World" messages
- Angular component consuming C# API with structured response
- Environment-specific API URL configuration
- Google Cloud deployment ready (Cloud Run + Firebase)
- CORS properly configured for cross-origin requests

#### Next Steps (Iteration 2)
- Authentication system implementation
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control for B2B users

## Testing Strategy ✅ COMPLETED

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Integration Tests**: API and Web service integration testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing with Playwright
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions

#### Integration Tests (`integration-tests/`)
**API Integration Tests (C# + xUnit)**
- ✅ HTTP endpoint testing with WebApplicationFactory
- ✅ CORS configuration validation
- ✅ JSON response structure validation
- ✅ Error handling and status codes
- ✅ Concurrent request handling

**Web Integration Tests (Angular + Vitest)**
- ✅ Service layer testing with HTTP mocking
- ✅ Component integration with API services
- ✅ Error state handling and UI updates
- ✅ Async operation testing

#### End-to-End Tests (`e2e/`) ✅ UPDATED
**Playwright Test Suite with Environment-Specific Configurations**

**Local Development Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`):
- Tests against `http://localhost:4200` (web) and `http://localhost:5000` (API)
- Uses `global-setup.ts` which waits for local services to start
- Standard timeouts for local development
- Run with: `npm test`, `npm run test:headed`, `npm run test:debug`

**Production Deployment Configuration** (`playwright.config.production.ts`):
- Tests against deployed services using environment variables
- Uses `global-setup.production.ts` which validates deployed service health
- Increased timeouts for network delays (45s navigation, 15s actions)
- Environment-aware URL resolution
- Run with: `npm run test:production`, `npm run test:production:headed`

**Environment Variables for Production E2E Tests**:
- `WEB_DEPLOYMENT_URL` or `FIREBASE_HOSTING_URL` - Web app URL
- `API_DEPLOYMENT_URL` or `CLOUD_RUN_URL` - API service URL

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Complete hello world user flow
- ✅ API connectivity validation (multiple endpoints: `/`, `/health`, `/api/health`, `/api/health/status`)
- ✅ Error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- ✅ Mobile device compatibility
- ✅ Performance and timeout handling
- ✅ CORS configuration testing
- ✅ Concurrent request handling
- ✅ Frontend-API integration validation

## Docker Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Issue Resolution**: Fixed Docker build failure due to missing Observability package reference

**Updated Dockerfile** (`apps/api/Dockerfile`):
- Build context moved to repository root
- Properly copies both API project and Observability package
- Multi-stage build with correct dependency resolution
- Optimized layer caching for dependencies

**Updated GitHub Actions Workflows**:
- `deploy-api-main.yml` and `deploy-api-branch.yml` updated
- Docker builds now run from repository root with `-f apps/api/Dockerfile .`
- Proper context allows access to referenced packages
